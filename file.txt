Daily goals target:

Planning weeks & months is generally an advanced thing to do for an individual, according to me. I mean if a guy is new, he should first focus on completing small daily targets, that does not require much effort. When a person is used to some good daily habits, he can try and become even better (it is an easier for him then)

Letâ€™s plan some habits that I have to do everyday without fail, these are not much but as a beginner they should be pretty effective.

1. Wake up at 7:00 AM (Not very hard to do!).
2. Exercise for 15 minutes (Some pushups, sit ups, lunges, etc.).
3. Read for 5 minutes (Before going to bed).
4. Manifest for 2 minutes (about your goals and what you want to be).
5. Meditate for 5 minutes (After you are done manifesting).
6. Work on your future skills for 1 hour least daily!
