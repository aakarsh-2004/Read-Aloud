# Read Aloud Project

This is a small hobby project created by me, if you want to have an AI read out your text this is the perfect project for you.
Create a file called file.txt and add according to your needs.
Then run the `main.py` file, leave everything else to python **:)**

If you want to run the file as soon as your system boots up, first convert main.py to main.exe using the command:
```
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```

Then copy the shortcut of python.exe file to `shell:startup`

shell:startup: Press Win+R then type `shell:startup`. Press Enter and paste the exe file shortcut
